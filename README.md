# R-Ladies SB x Central Coast Python Collab - Data Wrangling and Viz 

**NOTE:** This README is currently under construction

## Meetup Details

- **Event Description:** Mark you calendars for a first-of-its-kind R-Ladies SB x [Central Coast Python](https://www.meetup.com/central-coast-python/ble) Meetup on December 15th! Python can be a powerful alternative/complementary language to R, and while we here at R-Ladies are certainly partial to the latter, adding another language to our data science toolkit is something we are always excited for. We have collaborated with Central Coast Python to bring you an R to Python (and vice versa) translation workshop, where we will learn to wrangle and visualize the same dataset using both languages. You may choose to follow along on our screens or download the required software and packages to code along on your own machines. If you do not already have R and Python installed, please be sure to do so before the event on December 15th (see **Software Installation Instructions** below). We will be available to help troubleshoot any errors on _____. 

- **Event Date:** December 15, 2021 at 17:30-19:00PT (virtual only, Zoom link available upon RSVP)

## Software Installation Instructions

### Install R & RStudio and the `tidyverse` (expected install/test time: ~10-15 minutes)
1) If you have not yet installed R and/or RStudio (you will need both), follow the steps outlined [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KLYC_GcDLYeczSjJmZ5h4y525XILJbbL6r2-MxGCdtw/edit?usp=sharing).
2) We will be using the [{tidyverse}](https://www.tidyverse.org/) (a collection of packages designed for data science, particularly useful for data wrangling and visualization). If you do not yet have the {tidyverse} installed, run the following line of code in your RStudio Console: `install.packages("tidyverse")`
3) We encourage you to test that your installations are working as expected. Follow [these instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ItQy91G6QfKaX1-26lracpSbJ52JUie1HZb54LCa9sM/edit?usp=sharing) to ensure a smooth workshop ahead!

### Install Python & Anaconda (expected install/test time: ~X minutes)

### Install git/GitHub (expected install time: ~5 minutes)  
1) If you are not already using git/GitHub for version control, we recommend you get set up by following the steps outlined [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AQ4zAYxPHOObq-snnnRtEdwCC8TwIJsTHwpaKyvEyoA/edit?usp=sharing).
